[HOOK]
In a world drowning in endless rain, a dead man returns promising salvation. But is he a messiah, or the devil leading a dance of destruction?

[SUMMARY]
Set in a decaying collective farm in Hungary during the twilight of the Communist era, *Satantango* depicts a community trapped in mud, desolation, and mutual suspicion. The villagers, waiting for a final payout from the farm's closure, are plotting to cheat one another and escape their bleak existence.

Everything changes with a rumor: Irimiás, a charismatic figure they thought had died two years ago, is returning. Desperate for hope, the villagers project their messianic fantasies onto him. While they engage in a drunken, trance-like dance at the local pub, a horrific tragedy unfolds involving a young girl named Esti, who is completely ignored by the adults.

When Irimiás finally arrives, he masterfully manipulates the villagers, using their guilt over the tragedy and their greed for a better life. He convinces them to hand over their entire savings to build a utopian "model farm." Like a spellbound herd, they follow him, only to be led to abandoned ruins.

The brutal truth is revealed: Irimiás is a state informant and a con man. He scatters the villagers to different locations, leaving them more destitute than before. The novel ends with the village Doctor, the sole remaining observer, boarding up his window and writing the very sentences that began the book. The story reveals itself as a circular trap—a tango of six steps forward and six steps back—from which there is no escape.
